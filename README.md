# JavascriptGameTest

Although it started as my place to learn javascript, it has now evolved into a place where I put dumb games and school projects. Sorry for the lack of interface in the Navigation Page, but I can't be bothered, as I am here for Javascript, not HTML and CSS. Definitely not CSS. AHH A CSS BUG SMACK IT! Oh wait that was intentional? But... the code is so weird....
